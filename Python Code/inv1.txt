Jones: (The noose… it bears the marks of a struggle… Shouldn’t show this to the kid.)

Jones: (A vase that was knocked over presumably by the victim's feet. It’s pointing towards the backdoor.)

Jones: (The backdoor. It’s… locked from the outside. Maybe the autopsy team left through here.)

Jones: (The vase… kicked by the suicide victim, or caught in the struggle between two people? It faces the backdoor, perhaps where our killer left from.)

Jones: (Of course, the backdoor. Who could have locked it?)

Jones: (The noose.. If it was not a suicide, it shouldn’t bear the signs of a struggle. Where did this rope come from?)
